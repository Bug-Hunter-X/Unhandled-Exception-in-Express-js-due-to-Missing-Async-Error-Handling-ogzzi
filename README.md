This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: the lack of proper error handling for asynchronous operations. The `bug.js` file showcases an Express.js route that fetches user data.  If the data fetching operation (`getUserData` function) fails (simulated by throwing an error when the user ID is 'error'), the application crashes without providing informative error messages. The `bugSolution.js` file shows the improved version that implements comprehensive error handling using try...catch blocks.
